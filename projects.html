      <h2>Creating a Game in C# using the Unity Engine</h2>

      I started this project in the first Covid-19 lockdown, as I hadn’t used C# before and wanted to learn both the language and how to use Unity. The game is a card game based on the board game Four Souls, and allows me to experiment with creating UI, game logic and programming. This quickly became an obsession during the lockdown, and I spent countless hours on the project. However, I kept broadening the scope of the project which meant I then had to refactor a lot of code I had already written and re-create a lot of the user-interface. The project is still not complete although I am still working on it, but hindsight has taught me a valuable lesson; which is about planning and keeping to within a fixed scope of a project until that part is complete, so that I don’t end up continuously refactoring and not making much progress because of it. This can only be done with extensive planning and efficient Test-Driven Development, so I now ensure I take this approach when starting a project.

      <h2>Global Design Challenge</h2>

      My team and I developed an idea to provide a solution to the poor economic environment for a small village in South America, by creating a digital platform which the local population could utilise to increase profits. The main income for the area is fishing, so we put forward plans for a software-based marketplace to be built. This would allow the fishers to track, sell and market their catches on a day by day basis, to restaurants and customers in a nearby town. The experience taught me how to encourage the strengths of team members and support those in the team who were not as confident. I also learnt about the process in which a project of this type follows, as well as what it requires to ensure it becomes a success.

      <h2>Technology in Personal Life</h2>

      I have been able to use a dedicated pc as a Linux lab, so that I can learn and experiment with it. It is currently running Ubuntu and has allowed me to get familiar with how the operating system works, and the processes in which you need to follow to achieve certain tasks. I have also been able to see how this environment differs from Windows and the positives that come with both environments. My main setup is a windows PC which I built myself in 2017. I like to keep up to date with current hardware news, as I am always looking to upgrade my PC as and when I get the chance. I enjoy playing games on this PC, as well as fulfilling my other passion which is all things to do with cars, driving and gaming.
