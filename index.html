	  	<h1>Alex Matthews</h1>

			<p>I am currently studying Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sussex. I have created this website to keep up-to-date information about the projects, courses and personal work I am doing. If you need to know anything about me, you should be able to find it on this website and if it isnâ€™t then you can email me via <b>alexmatthews555@gmail.com.</b></p>

			<p>I also have a small selection of photos that I have taken on the Photography page, so that I can easily access them from anywehere if I need to. Photography, badminton and cars are my main passions outside of tech, so feel free to reach about any of those topics as well. </p>
