      <h1>University Course</h1>


      <h2>BSc in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at The University of Sussex</h2>


      The course has covered a range of programming languages so far, such as C, C++, Java & Web Development. Mathematics has also been a core component of the course throughout both the years I have been studying here. I have written a couple of small research reports on machine learning, cognitive science & artificial intelligence in web development. I have also covered topics such as data structures, algorithms, databases and in-depth research around the philosophy of cognitive science. During my time at the University of Sussex, I have been completing some personal projects. These include making a game in C# with Unity, competing in Unicode (programming competition against other universities) and playing around with a Linux lab.
