      <h1>University of Sussex</h1>


      <h2>BSc in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence</h2>


      <p>So far, I have achieved a First Class for both the years I have been at Sussex. The course has covered a range of programming languages so far, such as Python, C, C++, Java & Web Development. More recently, I have been working with NumPy, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Open-CV and Matplotlib to create neural networks, analyse images and learn about Machine Learning in general. I have 3 modules covering these topics this term which are Computer Vision, Acquired Intelligence & Adaptive Behaviour and Fundamentals of Machine Learning. Mathematics has also been a core component of the course throughout the years I have been studying here. I have written a couple of small research reports on machine learning, cognitive science & artificial intelligence in web development. I have also covered topics such as data structures, algorithms, databases and in-depth research around the philosophy of cognitive science. During my time at the University of Sussex, I have been completing some personal projects (more details can be found below). These include making a game in C# with Unity, competing in Varsity Code (programming competition against other universities), programming for the Formula Student team and playing around with a Linux lab. </p>

      <br>
      <h2>Formula Student</h2>
      <p>I am part of the Sussex Racing team, as the teamâ€™s programmer. This means I am creating a program for the mechanics to analyse all the data, as well as transferring the data from the main control unit within the car to the desktops in the garage. I am also working as part of the team to design and program the dashboard and analytical system for the car. </p>

      <br>
      <h2>Varsity Code</h2>
      <p>This is a programming competition with challenges set throughout the year, in which universities across the UK compete against each other. This provides a great opportunity to test my knowledge on several different programming languages and push myself to become better at them in a competitive environment. Last year, as a team we made it to the finals and hope to do the same again this year. </p>
