      <h2>The Inevitability and Necessity of Interdisciplinarity</h2>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/Adiboo1/Adiboo1.github.io/raw/main/reports/Interdisciplinarity.pdf">Download a copy of report</a></p>

      <p>This report was intended to explore whether or not interdisciplinarity in cognitive science was inevitable, and why it is one of the most important insights about the nature of the mind. Without an interdisciplinary approach, our understanding of the mind would be far less. Cognitive science is fundamentally interdisciplinary and there is good reason for this, such as the impact of the scale of cognitive science which this article discusses. The article also explores some of the key features of interdisciplinarity and why they are useful to the field of cognitive science, as well as some of the reasons some studies arenâ€™t interdisciplinary.</p>

      <p>This report was written to highlight the importance of balance when regulating developing technologies and to provide some key areas where balance is particularly important. The report discusses different approaches taken by different regions, as well as some of the problems that can arise from these. Addressing some of the issues around regulations on a global level is also a key part of this report, to demonstrate scenarios from which lessons can be learnt.</p>
